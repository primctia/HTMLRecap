        <h3 style="color:antiquewhite;">Wuthering Heights</h3>
        <p style="color:antiquewhite">1801. - I have just returned from a visit to my landlord - the
            solitary neighbour that I shall be troubled with. This is
            certainly a beautiful country! In all England, I do not believe
            that I could have fixed on a situation so completely removed from
            the stir of society. A perfect misanthropist's heaven: and Mr.
            Heathcliff and I are such a suitable pair to divide the desolation
            between us. A capital fellow! He little imagined how my heart
            warmed towards him when I beheld his black eyes withdraw so
            suspiciously under their brows, as I rode up, and when his fingers
            sheltered themselves, with a jealous resolution, still further in
            his waistcoat, as I announced my name.
            
            'Mr. Heathcliff?' I said.
            
            A nod was the answer.</p>

        <h3 style="color:antiquewhite;">Jane Eyre</h3>
        <p style="color:antiquewhite">There was no possibility of taking a walk that day. We had been wandering, indeed, in the leafess shrubbery an hour in the morning, but since dinner (Mrs. Reed, when there was no company, dined early) the cold winter wind had brought with it clouds so somber, and a rain so penetrating, that further out-door exercise was now out of the question.

            I was glad of it: I never liked long walks, especially on chilly afternoons: dreadful to me was the coming home in the raw twilight, with nipped fingers and toes and a heart saddened by the chidings of Bessie, the nurse, and humbled by the consciousness of my physical inferiority to Eliza, John, and Georgiana Reed.</p>

            <em><b>Did you know Wuthering Heights by Kate Bush is one of the saddest songs ever sang?</b>
            <br>
            It's true! I say so myself.</em>
